# PDF Chapter Splitter

Split PDF files by their chapters directly in your browser. Perfect for working with GPTs that have page limits - split your large PDFs into smaller chunks to get summaries and analysis within the token limits of free versions.

Note: Your PDF must have a table of contents/outline for this to work.
